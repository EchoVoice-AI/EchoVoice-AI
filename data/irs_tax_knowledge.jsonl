The online system lets you request either a short-term payment plan or a longer-term monthly installment agreement, depending on how much you owe.

It is generally considered only when you cannot pay in full or doing so would create significant financial hardship. When reviewing an offer, the IRS looks at your ability to pay, income, necessary living expenses, and equity in assets.

Unlike a lien, which is just a claim, a levy can garnish wages, remove funds from your bank account, or seize and sell property such as vehicles or real estate. The IRS normally sends several notices, including a Final Notice of Intent to Levy and information about your right to a hearing, before issuing a levy.

Understanding this difference helps taxpayers see why early action to resolve a balance is important, before the IRS escalates to a levy.", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/whats-the-difference-between-a-levy-and-a-lien"}
